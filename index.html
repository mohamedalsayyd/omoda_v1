                >In September 2022, the OMODA brand will introduce a new
                fastback crossover . The car will become an art object at one of
                the main events of the year - the blazar young contemporary art
                fair, which will be held from September 14 to 18 at the Museum
                of Moscow.</b
              >
              <br /><br />
              To create an art installation, blazar curators chose three young
              artists: Sasha Puchkova, Maxim Emelyanov and Nikita Khodak. Each
              of them created their own unique design sketch especially for
              OMODA . As a result of voting in the official OMODA community,
              Maxim Yemelyanov won.
              <br /><br />
              When creating the sketch, the artist used machine learning and an
              artificial neural network. The main idea of ​​the work is to
              create an ideal world, the matrix in which creativity and futurism
              are encrypted. Maxim Emelyanov was inspired by the concept of the
              OMODA brand - "Art in motion" - art in motion.
              <br /><br />
              The design will be applied to the car, and the new OMODA crossover
              will appear before the general public as an art object, a symbol
              of the synthesis of art and modern technology.
              <br /><br />
              Blazar Fair is the most important event of the year in the art
              world. Galleries, creative associations and young independent
              artists present their vision of the present and future from a new
              angle.<br /><br />More details in the official OMODA Telegram

            <h3>REFERENCE INFORMATION:</h3>
            <br /><br /><b>Powertrain</b> <br /><br />The OMODA model will be
            equipped with a 1.5T high-performance gasoline turbocharged engine
            with a capacity of 147 hp. with a torque of 210 Nm, which is
            achieved in the crankshaft speed range from 1750 to 4000 rpm, and at
            least 80% of its maximum value is available throughout the entire
            engine operating range (from 1350 to "cut-off" at 5500 rpm). This
            "elasticity" improves dynamics and is achieved through the use of a
            Garrett (Honeywell) turbocharger and BorgWarner's dual-phase
            adjustment of the intake and exhaust camshafts. <br /><br />The
            engine is paired with a reliable and durable CVT25 transmission,
            which was ranked among the best in the "Top 10 Best Transmissions in
            the World" ranking, compiled by the Lopal Cup Automotive Evaluation
            Academy expert community last year. The CVT25 transmission was
            recognized as the best along with the Hydra-Matic 10L80 (Cadillac
            CT6), ZF 8HP (BMW 5), DQ400e (Volkswagen), TCT9 (Mercedes) and
            others. It integrates a number of advanced technologies, such as an
            independent hydraulic system, a steel belt from Bosch that improves
            transmission efficiency up to 92.5%, a high-efficiency
            flow-controlled vane pump with low viscosity oil, which has
            excellent performance in terms of reliability, fuel consumption,
            dynamic response and low noise. <br /><br />The CVT25 has a maximum
            torque of 250 Nm, the gear ratio reaches 7.07, thereby expanding the
            rpm selection range to achieve better fuel economy and better
            acceleration performance. Up to 97% transmission efficiency also
            minimizes power consumption. This allows you to enjoy a trip with
            low fuel consumption and a high level of comfort. <br /><br />Such a
            power unit provides acceleration of the OMODA fastback crossover to
            100 km / h in 9.9 seconds, the maximum speed is 195 km / h. Fuel
            consumption for every 100 kilometers is 5.8 liters in suburban mode,
            7.1 liters in mixed mode and 9.5 liters in city mode. Eco / Normal /
            Sport modes are available to the driver, depending on the purpose
            and individual preferences. The manufacturer allows the use of
            gasoline with a 92-octane rating. <br /><br /><b
              >Dimensions and suspension</b
            >
            <br /><br />The dimensions of the OMODA crossover, built on the T1X
            modular platform, are: length - 4400 mm, width - 1830 mm, height -
            1588 mm. Thanks to the wheelbase of 2630 mm, the interior of the car
            turned out to be spacious and roomy. The volume of the luggage
            compartment is 378 liters. The ground clearance is 190 mm, which
            provides good cross-country ability on light off-road and
            comfortable parking at high curbs. <br /><br />Front suspension type
            McPherson and rear - semi-independent, spring, with hydraulic
            telescopic shock absorbers and anti-roll bar.

                >Until the end of autumn, the futuristic fastback crossover
                OMODA will go on sale on the Russian market. The model at the
                first stage will be presented in three trim levels, 13 color
                combinations and one power unit.</b
              >
              <br /><br />OMODA's model will be equipped with a 1.5T
              high-performance gasoline turbocharged engine with a capacity of
              147 hp. with a torque of 210 Nm, which is achieved in the
              crankshaft speed range from 1750 to 4000 rpm, and at least 80% of
              its maximum value is available throughout the entire engine
              operating range (from 1350 to "cut-off" at 5500 rpm). This
              "elasticity" improves dynamics and is achieved through the use of
              a Garrett (Honeywell) turbocharger and BorgWarner's dual-phase
              adjustment of the intake and exhaust camshafts. <br /><br />The
              engine is paired with a reliable and durable CVT25 transmission,
              which was ranked among the best in the "Top 10 Best Transmissions
              in the World" ranking, compiled by the Lopal Cup Automotive
              Evaluation Academy expert community last year. The CVT25
              transmission was recognized as the best along with the Hydra-Matic
              10L80 (Cadillac CT6), ZF 8HP (BMW 5), DQ400e (Volkswagen), TCT9
              (Mercedes) and others. It integrates a number of advanced
              technologies, such as an independent hydraulic system, a steel
              belt from Bosch that improves transmission efficiency up to 92.5%,
              a high-efficiency flow-controlled vane pump with low viscosity
              oil, which has excellent performance in terms of reliability, fuel
              consumption, dynamic response and low noise. <br /><br />The CVT25
              has a maximum torque of 250 Nm, the gear ratio reaches 7.07,
              thereby expanding the rpm selection range to achieve better fuel
              economy and better acceleration performance. Up to 97%
              transmission efficiency also minimizes power consumption. This
              allows you to enjoy a trip with low fuel consumption and a high
              level of comfort. <br /><br />Such a power unit provides
              acceleration of the OMODA fastback crossover to 100 km / h in 9.9
              seconds, the maximum speed is 195 km / h. Fuel consumption for
              every 100 kilometers is 5.8 liters in suburban mode, 7.1 liters in
              mixed mode and 9.5 liters in city mode. Eco / Normal / Sport modes
              are available to the driver, depending on the purpose and
              individual preferences. The manufacturer allows the use of
              gasoline with a 92-octane rating. <br /><br />Front suspension
              type McPherson and rear - semi-independent, spring, with hydraulic
              telescopic shock absorbers and anti-roll bar. <br /><br />The
              dimensions of the OMODA crossover, built on the T1X modular
              platform, are: length - 4400 mm, width - 1830 mm, height - 1588
              mm. Thanks to the wheelbase of 2630 mm, the interior of the car
              turned out to be spacious and roomy. The volume of the luggage
              compartment is 378 liters. The ground clearance is 190 mm, which
              provides good cross-country ability on light off-road and
              comfortable parking at high curbs.
